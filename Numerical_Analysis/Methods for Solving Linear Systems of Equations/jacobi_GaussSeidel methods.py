    """
    Performs Jacobi iterative method to solve the system of linear equations Ax = b.

    This method is an iterative approach to find an approximate solution to a
    system of linear equations. It is particularly useful for large, sparse matrices
    and when the coefficient matrix `A` is diagonally dominant.

    Parameters:
        A (list of lists): Coefficient matrix of size n x n.
        b (list): Solution vector size n.
        X0 (list, optional): Initial guess for the solution vector. Defaults to a zero vector.
        TOL (float, optional): Tolerance for the convergence criterion. Defaults to 0.00001.
        N (int, optional): Maximum number of iterations allowed. Defaults to 200.
        verbose (bool, optional): If True, prints iteration details. Defaults to True.

    Returns:
        list: Approximate solution vector `x` of size n.

    Raises:
        ConvergenceError: If the method fails to converge within the maximum number of iterations.

    Notes:
        - The convergence of the Jacobi method is guaranteed if `A` is strictly
          diagonally dominant. If the matrix is not diagonally dominant, convergence
          is not guaranteed but may still occur in some cases.
        - The norm of the difference between successive approximations is used
          as the convergence criterion.

    Performs Gauss-Seidel iterations to solve the system of linear equations Ax = b.

    Parameters:
        A (list of lists): Coefficient matrix of size n x n.
        b (list): Solution vector size n.
        X0 (list, optional): Initial guess for the solution. Defaults to a zero vector.

    Raises:

    Notes:
        - The Gauss-Seidel method updates each component of the solution vector
          immediately after it is computed, unlike the Jacobi method, which updates
          all components simultaneously at the end of each iteration.
        - The convergence of the method is guaranteed if the coefficient matrix `A` is
          strictly diagonally dominant or symmetric positive definite.
        - The norm of the difference between successive approximations is used
          as the convergence criterion.
        - If the matrix `A` is not diagonally dominant, the method may still converge
          in some cases, but this is not guaranteed. A warning will be displayed if
          convergence occurs despite the lack of diagonal dominance.
